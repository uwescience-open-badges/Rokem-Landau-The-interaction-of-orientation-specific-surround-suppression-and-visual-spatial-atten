# submissions
This is a repository to receive submissions by uploading to the web. There are three ways to submit your materials, please choose whatever is most convenient: 

1. Email it to `bmarwick@uw.edu`, note that we probably wont be able to accept a file greater than ~30 mb by email
2. Attach your file to a GitHub issue post (25 mb limit), please start a [new issue here](https://github.com/uwescience-open-badges/submissions/issues/new) to attach your file
3. Shar with us the URL to a location (for example your GitHub repo) where we can download your file in a [new issue](https://github.com/uwescience-open-badges/submissions/issues/new). Just post the URL to your repository, and we'll get your file from there. 
Once a submission is recieved, a new repository is created in this organisation to hold the submitted file and the review correspondence. 

Before you submit, please ensure you have prepared your poster/presentation/paper according to [our instructions](https://github.com/uwescience-open-badges/about/blob/master/README.md#how-do-i-get-a-badge)
